				<h2>Welcome To The Village of Meacham</h2>
				<span class="byline">Peaceful Oasis of the Prairies</span> </div>
			  <p id="hist"><strong>HISTORY</strong><BR>The village of Meacham was incorporated in 1912.  At that time there was a train station, grain elevators, an agricultural based economy and a population of approximately 100 people.
				 Over the decades, the village has experienced expansion to a height of approximately 400 people and is now approximately 100 and growing.</p>
				<p id="volff"><strong>VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS</strong><BR>The village of Meacham boasts an experienced volunteeer firefighter team.  Our zone may be quiet, but our two fire trucks are always ready to assist our community.
				 Meetings are the first and third Wednesday of the month, and new recruits are always welcome.  The team is happy to be called upon to bartend for functions at the Community Hall,
			   and our individual members can often be found around town helping a neighbor in need.</p>
				<p id="comhall"><strong>COMMUNITY HALL</strong><BR>The Meacham community hall serves many functions for the village.  Birthday, wedding, and anniversary celebrations often bring out the entire village to dance
				 and eat and celebrate together.  It serves as a home for many Recreation Board activities, including weekly ice cream socials in the summer months.  The village fall suppers
		   	 at the hall bring in neighbors from around east central Saskatchewan.  Last, but certainly not least, the hall serves as our functioning emergency shelter.</p>
			  <p id="cpost"><strong>CANADA POST</strong><BR>Meacham has a full service Canada Post outlet, staffed mornings and afternoons Monday through Friday.  Providing convenience,
				 friendly service, and reliability; it is perfectly suited for online shopping to make small town living as effortless as the city.</p>
				<p id="recb"><strong>RECREATION BOARD</strong><BR>Our extremely dedicated Recreation Board works tirelessly, year round, to raise money, create events, and engage in community projects that bring a great deal of
				 life and joy to our village.  Ice cream nights in the summer make for a wonderful town social; and our annual Duck Derby is the shining jewel of their hard work.  Our Rec Board is another shining example of what makes Meacham
				 such a great community and anyone interested in volunteering can contact meachamrecboard@gmail.com.</p>
				<p id="soci"><strong>HISTORICAL SOCIETY</strong><BR>On April 8th, 2008 the Meacham Historic and Cultural Society was formed and has been registered as a non-profit organization in the Province of Saskatchewan. With
				 an independent board of directors, it currently operates the Meacham and District Museum, hosts the annual Father's Day Show and Shine (Car Show) and organizes events that serve the organization's mandate.</p>
			  <p id="row"><strong>REVERSE OSMOSIS WATER</strong><BR>The village of Meacham boasts an incredibly reliable well with full reverse osmosis system!  This means clean, safe, water to drink and wash with; without the need
				 for home water softening systems or treatments.  Water is tested twice daily and is reported on at monthly council meetings.</p>
				<p id="react"><strong>REACT</strong><BR>Meacham is conveniently served by React Waste Management in several ways.  Our village enjoys weekly curbside trash pickup, local recycling bins, and
				 a municipal dump just a short drive down Highway 2.</p>
				<p id="mctow"><strong>MICROCELL TOWER</strong><BR>Meacham was one of the first villages in Saskatchewan to benefit from Sasktel's investment in rural communities for cellular communications.  In addition to
				 full bar, crystal-clear cellular service, Meacham also has access to Sasktel 50 internet service; and may soon be receiving fibreoptic service.</p>
				<p id="art"><strong>ART & THEATER</strong><BR>Meacham is home to several artists, galleries, and even a full-facility indoor/outdoor theater.</p>
